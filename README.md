global miniscreens of channels broadcasting in global at that time, such as olympics coverage options from x # countries globally visual i already had framework for the screenful settings changeable newsbanners simple no one uses screensaves anymore no need but it's kind of fun to watch already done in different forms this is minimal only text based i agree with myself it is useless

subscriber rate in NY within the 8.42 mill population and the 500,000 NYC households have no Internet access), where they‚Äôd generate an approximate 2-hour quota of time per day, promoted thru a widget irresistible to participants, with only the households with no Internet access, and the active screensaver/widget, it would take approximately 77 days, which is less than the time the NY Health Act stalled, to raise the $63 billion needed to fix the entire NYCHA system, and have enough left over to buy out the Senate into supporting the NYHealth Act (assuming we are not pretending that money doesn‚Äôt make the gov‚Äôt/lobbyist lol system go round) lol.

 there are 18,000 cctv purchased in 11 months in North Korea if the UK has 87,000 then the UK has 745% of NKs cctv and 200,000 in South Korea that would make 1,111.1repeating percent of North Korea so I guess they/we have something in common. [Samin, the 11.11 was for you.]

If just 25 percent (Korea‚Äôs national volunteer rate) of the 50 million people in Korea voluntarily pitched 10 bucks for every time NK violated/limited its people's rights similarly to how the Rights vs Rights group did in Wunsiedel against the Fascist march, and used a portion of it along with a volunteer group of disenfranchised devs to build a monolith of portable library devices like the Lantern that can receive free data from space in each major city, and offer free protected unlimited data to those who spend a 2-hour quota of time putting up a screensaver that automatically circuits one hit per sec on a website where hit raises 25 cents per click (given the 75% digital subscriber rate in Korea within the 26mill employed population), promote it thru a fashion accessory irresistible to the kids who flaunt their wealth to date each other in cafes, this fashion accessory to symbolise that they‚Äôll donate an ‚Äúextra cup‚Äù for an anonymous NK individual on threat day for each cup of coffee sold in each of the 12,300 coffee shops (280 per day approx)‚Ä¶ it would take approximately 82 threats, aka a little over a year, more depending on the unobtrusive extraction rate of specific groups to drain NK of its entire civilian population, and thereby any means of sustainability for the country outside of the regime‚Äôs military
