I can find or rebuild my unitmilk, the pastel toned monitor wrapper beautiful always reactive on every background somewhat tedious, the small exe that drops tinysmoll snow piles on the screen with did I mention already? sry that was from a few decades ago, and I was cannot build compiler at that Boolean age before compilers or visual c everything is in any book why not etc

forgot needing to do something specific   

- implement new version of street artist fund w customizable charms and indicate to take $ % off alcohol voluntary relinquish some portion of alcohol purchase to support collective street artist fund 100% of proceeds go directly to artists, w different forms of royalties to involved 

- resuscitate SexyCongress including facial metric sexiness forms not touch Senate for now bc controversy

Installation time perceptions alteration via vis a vis and with cctv redactive mirrors in a neutral room using regular + '' the feeling is given to add by participant in positions, may use a ticket provided colored three dots on the floor with their open reason of choice maximal, center, and minimal experiences, 

- As of now, do not have the programming acapabilities to create approximal live reactive map showing lines from identifying an open list of location points within the [can do map may require googleapis] to correlatory locations of live transactions (scraper for individual, short parameter, hedge on a time axis) 

- A second iteration, for news occurrences, as well as the possibility to do an expansion of lines outwards from point with retrofitted dotted line outputs for, e.g. legal dates of presented occurrences, directly related maps outwards of historical precedents (specifically relevant to racial violence, just locations/names/dates/ no harrowing bipoc folks), + the speed variables can be changed manipulated with open parameters to create of with what we consider time in a basic modular circular structure with considerations, mid-experience, the [omitted]?, personal research, the eigengrau gestalt hyperaware of time passing and unawareness, video of duration and visitor interaction, content site no need self made tech rider proposal

- The third iteration, for strictly the calendar for further research from the advantages of being able to represent large trends visually

- The question of US externally (+ extraordinary) renditioned tested policies 

- How externally independently generated strategies in different regions are adapted and re-implemented in the US 

- If not, at least I can still make folks visualize it in their heads with even consumer limited inputs are enough to go far

the installation is fully neutral in form, presentation, ; purpose of and will be seen as the project progresses

is it safe to put my ideas here esp when I have been extraordinarily abused for triple standards

The neutral friend of everyone on a social media result and its complementary question -->
 yay I saw this happen on a small scale 

Imagine dealing with one‚Äôs work environment or residential management in the United States as if English was the only language in the world you didn‚Äôt learn ü§£

I‚Äôm sure probably someone by now has made figuring out how it would sound for a self learning ai to infer English; what and where would the ‚Äúglitches‚Äù be?  What are the most uninimitable and the variant from any metric? If one was to put a bias on one or other, would dialects develop naturally, and where does a model of geohistorical dialectic differ the most?  ‚ÄúDecoding‚Äù connections between language process what are sociological demographic traits of regions with most machine predictably similar trends?  I lost my thot of train

I look forward to increasing my inputting speed on the keypads even further ha ha ha:  In fact, I could probably waste time soldering or programming some miniature automatic units that auto input your phone number via worn proximity in the Duane Reade‚Äôs, and make a fantastically choose out of 6 superfast beeps into the machine or even an accessibility autopresser.  You put key in numbers in device, like those whom would need an automatic cube solver?  Less refined kind of mechanism except not permutative just fixed ! And Autocad dimensions of keypad.  Design around putting in input in one quick STAMP and blelrlrl there
I feel as if elderly folx whom want their u know points would enjoy them.  Am i an elderly folk?  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/
eventually, the immediate aforementioned can become a street option for alternate communally sponsored Social Security services.  we all know the enormous cracks in our system. I suppose we will have to fill them in before we all get murdered before even getting to a witheringly malnourished geriatric lives due to variously string to stagflation etc  


the every economic model system in the world interface was my idea and not programmer non ability more knowledge can tell u has changed current was my idea from two decades ago and it is nice to know what many things can be done has nothing to do with the interest rates of any country I am not sorry! 

'i understand all tlfcfol factors of bourse market just saying it is fantastically fun to consider, think about and extend in fanciful or non fanciful manners ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø also in if I wasted time making the 3d online model w it  perfectionistically fun to look at so much work would be required to make it reactive 

Shared accounts within NYC not need to be in person networked to the limit of followership, a collection of accounts to push strategic choices by branching modular subgroups, and the profit comes from the wider exposure but wouldn't overload any individual account bc all it would be is a option .  Or, brute force in-person just accrue followers for desired content once chosen self or otherwise

I don't think really studying what any specific company does or forcing a head of the company to be Rupert Murdoch naked outside on a rainy day can still be my safeword to yeah

#spaceofforgetting make 
subscriber rate in NY within the 8.42 mill population and the 500,000 NYC households have no Internet access), where they‚Äôd generate an approximate 2-hour quota of time per day, promoted thru a widget irresistible to participants, with only the households with no Internet access, and the active screensaver/widget, it would take approximately 77 days, which is less than the time the NY Health Act stalled, to raise the $63 billion needed to fix the entire NYCHA system, and have enough left over to buy out the Senate into supporting the NYHealth Act (assuming we are not pretending that money doesn‚Äôt make the gov‚Äôt/lobbyist lol system go round) lol.

 there are 18,000 cctv purchased in 11 months in North Korea if the UK has 87,000 then the UK has 745% of NKs cctv and 200,000 in South Korea that would make 1,111.1repeating percent of North Korea so I guess they/we have something in common. [Samin, the 11.11 was for you.]

If just 25 percent (Korea‚Äôs national volunteer rate) of the 50 million people in Korea voluntarily pitched 10 bucks for every time NK violated/limited its people's rights similarly to how the Rights vs Rights group did in Wunsiedel against the Fascist march, and used a portion of it along with a volunteer group of disenfranchised devs to build a monolith of portable library devices like the Lantern that can receive free data from space in each major city, and offer free protected unlimited data to those who spend a 2-hour quota of time putting up a screensaver that automatically circuits one hit per sec on a website where hit raises 25 cents per click (given the 75% digital subscriber rate in Korea within the 26mill employed population), promote it thru a fashion accessory irresistible to the kids who flaunt their wealth to date each other in cafes, this fashion accessory to symbolise that they‚Äôll donate an ‚Äúextra cup‚Äù for an anonymous NK individual on threat day for each cup of coffee sold in each of the 12,300 coffee shops (280 per day approx)‚Ä¶ it would take approximately 82 threats, aka a little over a year, more depending on the unobtrusive extraction rate of specific groups to drain NK of its entire civilian population, and thereby any means of sustainability for the country outside of the regime‚Äôs military
