I was considering being able to circumvent establishment politics to fundraise for a small community fund: 
 
For example, a tiny designation that gives (specified benefits) in view of taking an (elective %, or standardized to preferences of participant establishments, or specific $ amount*) of a person’s drink at an establishment, to be deposited in a fund, that can go towards a specific community cause (voted upon by the participants?, or to benefit the street employees of NYC,  and/or young artists and musicians)?   It could be as easy in implementation as requesting drinking establishments to add an extra etpos button for *, and to be able to tie that * to a QR code handout that gives the bearer of the designation a set of “points” for having electively relinquished a small portion of their drink.  The points can be exchanged for possibly custom artworks, tiny social benefits, or, a ticket to a contributorawesome celebration hosted somewhere!*  This would probably require a light webapp, which (due to lack of specialized expertise) I could provide, but would take some time.
 
In participating, if listed as a non-profit status, it might be possible to implement a way to designate small-businesses under promoting a “charitable cause (directly benefiting the local constituents of the city)” and thereby be able to arrange for a possible extra margin of tax breaks, minor payouts, or some form of extra benefits for the participating businesses.  If the latter is not viable, then I knew a few legal avenues to designate small businesses under a different category of small philanthropy, or would be happy to assist researching how to do so.  In fact, I am even friendly to the notion of doing the footwork personally and can target every establishment starting from a strategy of safe and amenable areas, possibly with overlap to the NYHA-supporting venues.  I’m trying to remember what the technical terminology was, but
 
I’ve discussed this lightly with some establishments; they are in enthusiastic support of the potential of the idea.  On a staff level, one owner mentioned possible difficulties in implementing a “smaller drink” – would it be a “pony cup” situation (either way, one bottle of alcohol contains 50+ shots, so the question of an actual amount outside of a weighted racks bar could be relatively negligible).  I would not mind self-funding some of the startup revenue, although I do not particularly foresee that that being necessary.  
 
Also, some notes that might be of relevant applicable interest (or to your previous knowledge):
 
The vast majority of service jobs are not currently unionized outside of informal arrangements; there is an extant disparity between industrial job protections given equitable depending ranges of occupational hazards, and the fact that industrial plants can be relocated across international boundaries unlike service sectors

*As far as I’ve read, the highest margin of return is possible from an open elective range method (Yale biz, later organically implemented also by entertainment groups)

The neutral friend of everyone on a social media result and its complementary question -->
 yay I saw this happen on a small scale 

Imagine dealing with one’s work environment or residential management in the United States as if English was the only language in the world you didn’t learn 🤣

I’m sure probably someone by now has made figuring out how it would sound for a self learning ai to infer English; what and where would the “glitches” be?  What are the most uninimitable and the variant from any metric? If one was to put a bias on one or other, would dialects develop naturally, and where does a model of geohistorical dialectic differ the most?  “Decoding” connections between language process what are sociological demographic traits of regions with most machine predictably similar trends?  I lost my thot of train

I look forward to increasing my inputting speed on the keypads even further ha ha ha:  In fact, I could probably waste time soldering or programming some miniature automatic units that auto input your phone number via worn proximity in the Duane Reade’s, and make a fantastically choose out of 6 superfast beeps into the machine or even an accessibility autopresser.  You put key in numbers in device, like those whom would need an automatic cube solver?  Less refined kind of mechanism except not permutative just fixed ! And Autocad dimensions of keypad.  Design around putting in input in one quick STAMP and blelrlrl there

Shared accounts within NYC not need to be in person networked to the limit of followership, a collection of accounts to push strategic choices by branching modular subgroups, and the profit comes from the wider exposure but wouldn't overload any individual account bc all it would be is a option .

subscriber rate in NY within the 8.42 mill population and the 500,000 NYC households have no Internet access), where they’d generate an approximate 2-hour quota of time per day, promoted thru a widget irresistible to participants, with only the households with no Internet access, and the active screensaver/widget, it would take approximately 77 days, which is less than the time the NY Health Act stalled, to raise the $63 billion needed to fix the entire NYCHA system, and have enough left over to buy out the Senate into supporting the NYHealth Act (assuming we are not pretending that money doesn’t make the gov’t/lobbyist lol system go round) lol.

 there are 18,000 cctv purchased in 11 months in North Korea if the UK has 87,000 then the UK has 745% of NKs cctv and 200,000 in South Korea that would make 1,111.1repeating percent of North Korea so I guess they/we have something in common. [Samin, the 11.11 was for you.]

If just 25 percent (Korea’s national volunteer rate) of the 50 million people in Korea voluntarily pitched 10 bucks for every time NK violated/limited its people's rights similarly to how the Rights vs Rights group did in Wunsiedel against the Fascist march, and used a portion of it along with a volunteer group of disenfranchised devs to build a monolith of portable library devices like the Lantern that can receive free data from space in each major city, and offer free protected unlimited data to those who spend a 2-hour quota of time putting up a screensaver that automatically circuits one hit per sec on a website where hit raises 25 cents per click (given the 75% digital subscriber rate in Korea within the 26mill employed population), promote it thru a fashion accessory irresistible to the kids who flaunt their wealth to date each other in cafes, this fashion accessory to symbolise that they’ll donate an “extra cup” for an anonymous NK individual on threat day for each cup of coffee sold in each of the 12,300 coffee shops (280 per day approx)… it would take approximately 82 threats, aka a little over a year, more depending on the unobtrusive extraction rate of specific groups to drain NK of its entire civilian population, and thereby any means of sustainability for the country outside of the regime’s military
