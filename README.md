subscriber rate in NY within the 8.42 mill population and the 500,000 NYC households have no Internet access), where they‚Äôd generate an approximate 2-hour quota of time per day, promoted thru a widget irresistible to participants, with only the households with no Internet access, and the active screensaver/widget, it would take approximately 77 days, which is less than the time the NY Health Act stalled, to raise the $63 billion needed to fix the entire NYCHA system, and have enough left over to buy out the Senate into supporting the NYHealth Act (assuming we are not pretending that money doesn‚Äôt make the gov‚Äôt/lobbyist lol system go round) lol. 

^ This was only the dumber of the silly ideas I had.  But then again, if I took a dollar out of my theoretical drinking fund every time I said this stuff and then alienated people by positing that someone‚Äôs gonna take my method of thinking here and use it to an effective applicable effect then I'll be left in the dust whilst folks call me "crazy" merely for posting a message that doesn't conform to the standards of vapid fad social media brevity, i‚Äôd have enough money to hire myself an indentured servant who can say "sane" things for me while I make a pilgrimage to the 38th parallel and get shot by the fully automated weaponry over there lol.

however far more interestingly, I can share with you every award I won and was otherwise bribed out of winning 

 Just saying this for kicks and giggles. eg some easy crunket I wrote years ago, from real statistics:

 there are 18,000 cctv purchased in 11 months in North Korea if the UK has 87,000 then the UK has 745% of NKs cctv and 200,000 in South Korea that would make 1,111.1repeating percent of North Korea so I guess they/we have something in common. [Samin, the 11.11 was for you.]

If just 25 percent (Korea‚Äôs national volunteer rate) of the 50 million people in Korea voluntarily pitched 10 bucks for every time NK violated/limited its people's rights similarly to how the Rights vs Rights group did in Wunsiedel against the Fascist march, and used a portion of it along with a volunteer group of disenfranchised devs to build a monolith of portable library devices like the Lantern that can receive free data from space in each major city, and offer free protected unlimited data to those who spend a 2-hour quota of time putting up a screensaver that automatically circuits one hit per sec on a website where hit raises 25 cents per click (given the 75% digital subscriber rate in Korea within the 26mill employed population), promote it thru a fashion accessory irresistible to the kids who flaunt their wealth to date each other in cafes, this fashion accessory to symbolise that they‚Äôll donate an ‚Äúextra cup‚Äù for an anonymous NK individual on threat day for each cup of coffee sold in each of the 12,300 coffee shops (280 per day approx)‚Ä¶ it would take approximately 82 threats, aka a little over a year, more depending on the unobtrusive extraction rate of specific groups to drain NK of its entire civilian population, and thereby any means of sustainability for the country outside of the regime‚Äôs military.

Yep, I am guilty of the slippery slope and the consequence fallacies, and there's another story ((about combatting brainwash, although mass forced hysteria is no indication of true sentiments: Not relevant because refugees love to acclimate themselves to SK)) Also, why extract refugees when with $46.8 billion Korea‚Äôs government can follow the US‚Äôs shining example as of yesterday and purchase several batches of Lockheed F-35 fighter jets (oh wait, they already did in 2013 for ‚Äúanti-nuclear‚Äù purposes). 

But then again, if I took a dollar out of my crap beer drinking fund for each hour I spent theorizing random shit, in several months I'd raise enough to indenture a slave child under whose moniker I can make that Lantern monolith, place it on the 38th parallel, publicise to everyone who wants anonymous free data to make a mandatory pilgrimage to it on the one day that it stands there, watch all the foreigners who go there to have photos taken of them and pump my fist vigorously in joy till the turrets take me down indiscriminate movement detection.  Meanwhile, my slave child can go ahead and not take over my Facebook accounts for my ostensibly lazy ass.  Don't take this portion seriously.   I'm not into indentured servitude nor patriarchy.   I did much, even the unrealistic conflated expectations.  With no credit, designation, pay, real respect, status, 

but I didn't share with you my best ideas anyway lol and others implemented the others to their own self aggrandizement and my own detriment gj don't call me Bismarck :P
